# Pokéfind 🔎
A basic, interfaceless Python app to find evo/devolutions about a provided Pokémon.

1. Includes an in-case sensitive design, allows for stuff like "PIKAchu"
2. Tells basic information like what level it evolves at, or what item it requires to evolve

## Internals 🤓
1. Uses **3 different endpoints** of the PokéAPI to make shit user friendly 😉
2. Entirely bugless, which means you can mess up and it won't care! 🤑
3. Clean and easy to understand internals.. don't fact check that 😥
4. Uses classes n' stuff because I wanna try and improve my knowledge in Python 🤓

## Downsides 😔
1. Written in like 48 hours for my 100% Pokédex grind in Pokémon Brick Bronze 🧱

Putting everything aside, this project is great if you want to quickly find what evo/devolutions a Pokémon has without spending your time looking on your browser. Sure, it could _at times_ be quicker than using this, but for the most part this'll be quicker.

If you want to support me and my work, feel free to star this, or any repository of mine! Stars help me stay motivated and I'll really appreciate ya for it. 💖
