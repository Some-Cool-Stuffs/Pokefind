# Pokéfind 🔎
A basic, interfaceless Python app to find evo/devolutions about a provided Pokémon.

1. Includes an in-case sensitive design, allows for stuff like "PIKAchu"
2. Tells basic information like what level it evolves at, or what item it requires to evolve

## Internals 🤓
1. Uses **3 different endpoints** of the PokéAPI to make shit user friendly 😉
2. Entirely bugless, which means you can mess up and it won't care! 🤑
3. Clean and easy to understand internals.. don't fact check that 😥
4. Uses classes n' stuff because I wanna try and improve my knowledge in Python 🤓

## Downsides 😔
1. Provides just the names, not levels, if it requires a stone, or any other information 😡
2. Messing up with a Pokémon name leaves a weird lookin' message, I didn't really account for this lol 🤣
3. Written in like 2 hours for my 100% Pokédex grind in Pokémon Brick Bronze 🧱

Putting everything aside, this project is great if you want to quickly find what evo/devolutions a Pokémon has without spending your time looking on your browser. Sure, it could _at times_ be quicker than using this, but for the most part this'll be quicker.

The design may not be ideal, but it's whatever, it does its job. It also handled Pokémon that don't have 3 evolutions, or even 2 evolutions! So it's great if you just want to quickly get some answers

Possibly in the future if I really am bugged by it, I'll add if it requires levels, stones, or specific requirements like trading or whatever.. But for now it'll stay the way it is.

If you want to support me and my work, feel free to star this, or any repository of mine! Stars help me stay motivated and I'll really appreciate ya for it. 💖
